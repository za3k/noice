/media/germinate is mounted via smb client.

Installation instructions:

- **/etc/fstab**: //192.168.1.17/videos   /media/germinate cifs ro,noauto,user,user=schelling,password=schelling 0 0
- **~/.bashrc**: alias watch="cd /media/germinate && /var/local/media-player/noice"

Troubleshooting
---
Q: After suspend + resume, tarragon hangs when starting 'noice' (watch), and any existing session may hang.
A: Kill the noice client using 'xkill'. Do 'sudo mount -lf /media/germinate' to stop the bleeding. I don't know the actual cause but it's been reported elsewhere as an smb issue. Remount if you want to watch movies.
