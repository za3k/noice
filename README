/media/germinate is mounted via rclone. Rclone must be installed.

Troubleshooting
---
Q: After suspend + resume, tarragon hangs when starting 'noice' (watch), and any existing session may hang.
A: Kill the noice client using 'xkill'. Do 'sudo mount -lf /media/germinate' to stop the bleeding. I don't know the actual cause but it's been reported elsewhere as an smb issue. Remount if you want to watch movies.
